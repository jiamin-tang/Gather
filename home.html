        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <h2><a style="color: #646464; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.teamgather.co/">Gather</a>, a company out of Y Combinator’s Summer 2020 batch, is building a tool that helps high-growth teams build and execute their onboarding, offboarding, and other People Operations programs. Gather replaces manual coordination with smart, automated communication powered by a deep integration with Slack. </h2>
        <h2>For Gather, we are designing an application that is suitable for desktop manipulation, since our target audience would be office workers who need to be on their computer to monitor and manage their working progress.
          We believe that those who work in large company and have complicated projects that need collaboration between departments would benefit a lot from this app, especially due to the large amoung of functionalities the app provides as well as a strong slack integration.

        <h1>Design</h1>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Design Principles & Inspirations</u></h2>
        <h2>The iterative design process follows the pipeline of brainstorming layout sets, creating low-fi wireframes, building hi-fi prototypes, iterating from criques from peers and industry experts and conducting user testing.</h2>
        <h2>Our inspiration of design comes from Slack, Notion, Trello, Cloze, and Facebook Workplace. In the final design, we wish that the main functionalities be centered around two modules--workspace & personal dashboard. Workspace is designed to form connections with company employees, automated slack message management system and team collaboration on projects. Personal dashboard focuses on sorting out personal tasks and duties from workspace. </h2>
        <h2>We designed for the desktop application. Our main idea is to make it simple, consistent and easy to navigate with color hierarchy and highlights. The layout takes the form of cards which is neat and well-organized. To put emphasis in the workplace, we want to use color palettes with low saturation colors, but have primary colors to highlight important messages. We also increased organization and tidiness of layout and used hierarchical navbar. </h2>
        <br>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Sketches</u></h2>
        <h2>Now let's walk through the iterative design process starting from brainstorming sketches to reflect as wide a variety of layouts as possible to get the ideas flowing.</h2>

Besides, they provided some compliments on the well organized layout and structure, reminding us on the right track. Since not everyone of them were familiar with Slack, it is hard for them to identify the main purpose of the slack dashboard. </p>

	          		<p><b>Task Description: </b></p>
	          		<p> The major emphasis of the connection task is to both build new connections within the company, and at the same time keep track of existing connections. To achieve this goal, two subtasks are created so users can achieve the main goal of keeping connections organized. </p>
	          		<p>
					<u>Subtask 1: </u>The users are asked to build new connections through the searching functionality, find the software engineer L.R., and add her to existing connections. 
					</p>
					<p>
					<u>Subtask 2: </u>The users are asked to find out more information about the existing information of one of his/her connections through exploring the existing connection network. Specifically, users are expected to find Jose G. from the marketing department and check out his email address. 
					 </p>

	          		<p><b>Users’ reactions:</b> </p>
	          		<p><u>User testing: </u> Among the three users we tested, most of the users were able to find L.R. and add her to existing connections, and also find Jose.G to check out his email. To find L.R, most of the users clicked on the search bar and look for software engineer L.R., then adding her to the connection by clicking on the add icon with “Add to personal connections.” All users are able to find Jose through clicking on the Marketing bubble in the personal connections page and navigate to his email address. This result validates our intention of building the page in two parts so users can both find new connections and also manage existing connections. One user also said she liked the layout of the bubble personal connections.</p>
	          		<p>

					<u>Errors:</u> Some users were having some trouble finding the specific persons in the task in the first place. This error might be a result of not knowing which page is the person’s existing connections and where to find new connections. One of the users wasn’t able to find L.R. since she didn’t notice the search bar was clickable and kept on searching for L.R. in the personal connections. To improve upon this user error, we might consider adding text instructions within the search bar indicating that the search bar allows user to search for both new and existing connections; if the user is an existing connection, the page will direct the user to the profile like that of Jose, if the person searched for is new, the page will provide a holistic result page of all people that matches information in the search bar.

          <li>
            Having a better indication that the bubble connection is existing personal connections

          <li>
            Make the calendar more noticeable on the homepage. For example, add a calendar icon under the personal dashboard section for direct tutorial.

          <li>Users seem to like to go back to home page a lot to navigate to other pages, it would also be nice to enable the function to handle simple tasks directly from the homepage</li>
